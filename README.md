Subdomain Enumeration Scanner is a cloud-first microservices tool designed to help you discover all the subdomains associated with a specific domain.

This tool provides a way to gather valuable information that can be used for security testing, or just gaining insights into a target domain's online presence.

## How It Works

The user initiates a POST request containing the target domain. Upon receiving the request, the handler parses and deserializes the payload into a local data structure. This data structure is then passed to a `scan` method responsible for identifying subdomains related to the given domain.

### Steps in the `scan` Method:

1. **Subdomain Discovery:**
   - The arguments are passed to `apiQuerySvc`, `aiBruteSvc`, and `bruteSvc`, which both return lists of subdomains. These lists are combined into a single result.

2. **DNS Resolution:**
   - The combined subdomain list is passed to `dnsResolveSvc`, which resolves the subdomains into their corresponding DNS addresse.

3. **Port Scanning:**
   - Here each subdomain are scanned for open ports.

4. **Response Construction:**
   - The final list, including subdomains and their open ports, is sent back as a response to the `frontend`.
